The Movie App is a web application designed for movie enthusiasts. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore, organize, and keep track of movies. The app offers several features to enhance the movie-watching experience.

With the Movie App, users can browse through a vast collection of movies. They can view movie details such as title, genre, release date, and synopsis. The app utilizes an external Movie API to fetch and display accurate and up-to-date information about each movie.

One of the key features of the app is the ability to create a personalized watchlist. Users can add movies they are interested in watching to their watchlist. This helps users keep track of movies they plan to watch in the future.

Additionally, users can mark movies as watched within the app. This allows them to keep a record of movies they have already seen. The watched movies section provides a convenient way to remember and review the movies they have enjoyed.

The Movie App also includes a search functionality. Users can enter the name of a movie in the search input, and the app will display relevant search results. Each search result includes the movie's title and image. Users can choose to add movies from the search results directly to their watchlist or mark them as watched.

The app is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. It ensures a seamless and enjoyable experience whether accessed from a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile phone.
